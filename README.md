# vae_sound_exploration
A deep dive into how VAE'S can help aid in audio sample generation for modern music production. 

This project is for my Capstone project in Data Science. The goal of this project is to generate unheard audio for usage in electronic music production.


REQUIREMENTS: 

Python 3.5 or higher. 

Tensorflow 2.5.0 or higher (use of 2.5.0) will mean the code will not need modification but any version higher and there may be issues. (You will need to read into this if this is the case).
